  Ever tried printing from Github? (What&amp;rsquo;s all that Github page crap around your content?)
  Now, &lt;a href="https://gitprint.com"&gt;gitprint.com&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to print github markdown with one simple URL change.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply view any markdown file on Github, then in your URL bar replace the github.com part of the URL with gitprint.com — your markdown file will be rendered to a beautiful, printable PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works for any blob file view (that&amp;rsquo;s a URL with &lt;code&gt;blog/master&lt;/code&gt; in it) as well as root-repo README.md files (there&amp;rsquo;s still afew more smarts that need to be added to detect other filenames).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself with the jQuery &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be late for my boat. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this bus for about an hour; there should have been 2 to have gone by us by now.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Still, the view out over the Agean sea is amazing, and how much can you expect of the Santorini bus system anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;

  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be late for my boat. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this bus for about an hour; there should have been 2 to have gone by us by now.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Still, the view out over the Agean sea is amazing, and how much can you expect of the Santorini bus system anyhow?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit in the hot Greek summer sunshine my mind wanders to startups, and tries to tie this experience back to my own work on &lt;a href="http://www.seneca.io"&gt;Seneca.io (smart SaaS board reporting)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it there are a number of issues here:
1. I&amp;rsquo;ve expected too much from the service
2. I&amp;rsquo;ve over invested. I could have walked to Fira twice by now. Each minute more I wait I raise the chances that I&amp;rsquo;ll miss my boat
3. A few taxi&amp;rsquo;s have passed by aleady - but they&amp;rsquo;re expensive for the distance I need to cover to the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lessons for startup marketeers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now my mind is tieing this all back to marketing. Remember: You are not your feature set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this great quote the other week, which goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business School&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to get to the port so I can catch my ferry back to Athens. Obviously the bus is the cheapest way to reasonably do this (walking is almost impossible given the cliffs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus will cost me about 4EUR, which is a reasonably good deal. A taxi, on the other hand, is 5x as expensive, and will cost me 20EUR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think of that 20EUR as me paying to hire a driver, his car and petrol, to drive me the ~10km distance to the port. But to me the customer, right now, standing in a hot bus shelter for the bus that never comes, that&amp;rsquo;s selling it short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 20EUR is really my cancellation insurance. It&amp;rsquo;s a 16EUR premium over the bus - which may never come -  to get me to the port, so I can catch my pre-paid 50EUR ferry back to Athens, so I can check into my hotel, and catch tomorrows £100 flight back to London.
And instead of sweating it out in a hot bus stop, I can sit under an umbrella with a cold Mythos beer, relaxed and browsing HN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s money well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So remember: you&amp;rsquo;re selling the hole, not the drill.&lt;/p&gt;

  After a few years absence I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say I&amp;rsquo;m re-releasing a personal online presence.
  The old site, flog.co.nz, is now dead-pooled, and will be directing users to the new domain, burmister.com.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So where have I been?&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy the past few years doing my own thang; starting up a few companies, seeing some success, some failure, and getting the shit kicked out of me generally (both professionally and personally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all this trial and tribulation I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot. 
&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s true: destruction is the birth of creation. So thank you, life. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to sharing some of all I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
