  After a few years absence I'm pleased to say I'm re-releasing a personal online presence.
  The old site, flog.co.nz, is now dead-pooled, and will be directing users to the new domain, burmister.com.

*So where have I been?* I've been busy the past few years doing my own thang; starting up a few companies, seeing some success, some failure, and getting the shit kicked out of me generally (both professionally and personally).

Through all this trial and tribulation I've learnt a lot. 
<br>
It's true: destruction is the birth of creation. So thank you, life. I'm looking forward to sharing some of all I've learnt with you soon.
