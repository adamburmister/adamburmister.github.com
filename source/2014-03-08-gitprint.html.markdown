  Ever tried printing from Github? (What's all that Github page crap around your content?)
  Now, <a href="https://gitprint.com">gitprint.com</a> makes it easy to print github markdown with one simple URL change.
</p>

Simply view any markdown file on Github, then in your URL bar replace the github.com part of the URL with gitprint.com â€” your markdown file will be rendered to a beautiful, printable PDF.

It works for any blob file view (that's a URL with `blog/master` in it) as well as root-repo README.md files (there's still afew more smarts that need to be added to detect other filenames).

Try it for yourself with the jQuery `README.md`
