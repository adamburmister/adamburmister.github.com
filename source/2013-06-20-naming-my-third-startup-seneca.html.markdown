  Stoicism and entrepreneurship are a wonderful match. It's a philosophy of life made for thoughtful, rational people living in an chaotic world.

<h3>About the title.</h3>

There are many schools of thoughts on naming your startup &mdash; mine is probably a bit different than most.

In previous startup's I've spent months agonizing over names. Now though, I have a simple naming stategy: I name them after people I admire (in the case of my 3rd startup, after a Roman stoic philosopher).

<strong>Ok, so this post isn't really about how to name your startup.</strong> Instead, it's a story of how I learned some hard lessons, and came to admire an ancient way of life.

You should know up front that this is a very personal story, one which exposes the worst days of my life. But, I think it's one important to share, and one that I chose to not feel embarassed about (which is, after all, in line with my stoic practices).

<h3>Shit happens.</h3>

Life as an entrepreneur is extremely difficult. Probably controversially, I even think there's an element of "earning your stripes" that comes along with the job: if you haven't felt like complete shit you probably haven't earned the title.
